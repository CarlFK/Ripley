Ripley - Python syntax sylabus and an app to present it one step at a time.

The app reads in a text file that contains:
something to be executed at the python prompt,
some comentary
what python will output.

Using Ripley and Python's Read Evaluate Print Loop, lead a group though the basic Python syntax.  The assumption is they know about programming and need to be introduced to Python.

The app will put the command text onto the clipboard so that the leader can paste it into a Python shell.
